The page stack has become a common pattern for digital gardens, popularized by [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). Usually it's a combination of horizontal and vertical scrolling, but got inspiration for this transition-based version from [Khift.com](https://khift.com/).

This one was originally designed as the main navigational feature for my original digital garden, but I dropped that project. So now I've repurposed it here, with the style of a magazine article. The stack shown here has 3 pages, but the positioning engine is setup so that it works with any number of pages, and also support adding or removing pages dynamically. I might add a showcase here later.

This also works on mobile, where the stacked is displayed vertically to look like drawers instead.
