This is a recreation of the sidebar on [Kin Studio's site](https://by-kin.com/). On their site, the sidebar is used to display information about the project, while the page itself shows a gallery of images.

Apart from the look and feel, the sidebar has good interaction with the scroll container. It collapses when scrolling down from the top, and expands when scrolling back all the way up. It also supports click-to-expand, escape to collapse, and click-outside to collapse behaviors like you would expect.
