This is the code for my digital garden / playground / portfolio / whatever. It's a place where I put my works, experiments, and everything in between. View the live site [here](https://chayut.me/?filter=all).

This project is strictly personal, and it's always a work in progress. It's public because why not, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't just copy it out right. I'm guessing the structure here is far from tidy or efficient. 

However, if you wanna learn how something works, go for it! They are derivatives of others' work anyway. Adapt it to your own projects, do with it as you please, and please let me know too (I want to see your work!). You can contact me via the info on the site.
