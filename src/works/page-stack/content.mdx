The page stack has become a common pattern for digital gardens, popularized by [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). Usually it's a combination of horizontal and vertical scrolling, but got inspiration for this transition-based version from [Khift.com](https://khift.com/).

I designed the stack as the main navigational feature for my original digital garden, but that project was dropped in favor of this current site. So now I've repurposed it here, as a showcase of the interaction. Try adding or removing pages using the controls, or click on each page to focus on it.

This also works on mobile, where the stacked is displayed vertically to look like drawers instead.
