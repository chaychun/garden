This piece explores two little interactions that I found interesting in the context of a grid layout, mocking a furniture catalog.

First is the hover effect, where the hovered item is enlarged, causing a layout shift. This one is seen from the sidebar navigation on [Grafik's site](https://grafik.co.nz/project/tom-gould/).

The other small one is the filter buttons inspired by ones over at [Nathan Riley's portfolio](https://www.nrly.co/). They have an interesting way to transition between the active and inactive states.
