This work explores smooth layout transitions when filtering content. The goal is to create engaging visual feedback that feels natural and responsive when switching between different content filters.

The interaction will include:

- Smooth morphing animations between different layout states
- Dynamic content rearrangement
- Visual feedback for active filters
- Responsive behavior across different screen sizes

This is currently a placeholder implementation that will be enhanced with the actual interactive behavior.
