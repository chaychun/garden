I love the playfulness of [Family's Drawer](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/family-tray-system), one of the many interactions explored in Emil Kowalski's [Animations on the Web course](https://animations.dev).

This interaction is my take on a similar idea: a single modal that changes size according to the content it wants to display in each state. I originally designed this to present project details and metadata, but after several design shifts, it ended up unused. So I've repurposed it here as a standalone interaction.
